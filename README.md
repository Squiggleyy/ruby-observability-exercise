# README

This app is intended to practice OTel instrumentation on a Ruby on Rails web application. The app is configured to easily be run as a monolith (no containers) or as a standalone docker container. It is not configured to run in Kubernetes, although this shouldn't be too hard to do if you'd like.

This project is a work-in-progress and will soon be enhanced with scripts to deploy the Observe Agent, etc.

Enjoy!
